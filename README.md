# Tweet Bot

This program is a script meant to be run daily and will tweet "i like <blank>".

There is a word list of over 1000 plural nouns to fill in the blank and this was meant to be fun to see grow on Twitter.

Unfortunately, I could not accomplish this using the free tier of a Twitter Developer account, so this code doesn't do anything for me.

### Installation Instructions

To install and run this project on your local machine:

    1. Download the zip file and unzip to your desired folder

    2. Create a list of however many plural nouns you want.

    3. Every time you run it, it will generate a tweet saying what you like that day.

    4. This will not run without a paid version of Twitter Developer so it errors out with error 403 from Twitter's API.

    5. Enjoy!
